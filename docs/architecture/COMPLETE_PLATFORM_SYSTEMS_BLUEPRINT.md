# Complete Platform Systems Blueprint

**Project:** Akaar — Global Multi-Vendor Marketplace  
**Status:** Living implementation specification  
**Canonical schema:** `prisma/schema.prisma`  
**Companion audit:** `docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md`  
**Model map:** `docs/architecture/prisma-model-usage-map.md`  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-11-03

> This document is the functional blueprint for the 49 platform systems. It defines what each system must do, the expected screens, the canonical data models, the API surface, and the implementation state evidenced by the current repository audit. It is not a claim that every listed feature already works.

## 1. Rules for using this blueprint

1. **Do not add a Prisma model/table just to create a page.** First identify the business capability, user journey, owning domain, API/service, and existing model/relation that will use it.
2. Treat `prisma/schema.prisma` as the canonical database contract. Do not add legacy compatibility fields merely to silence old queries.
3. Before proposing a schema change, inspect the model map and answer: what exact workflow is missing, why existing models/relations cannot support it, which service/API will write and read it, who owns it, and what migration/test proves it.
4. A page, route, model, or button is not proof of a working feature. A system is **Complete** only after authorization, persistence, validation, error handling, tests, and an end-to-end workflow pass.
5. Implement in dependency order. Preserve user changes and existing customer-facing layout unless a scoped redesign is explicitly approved.
6. Keep the real-estate/property and booking domain separate from product commerce while allowing shared identity and platform services.
7. Financial, stock, order, refund, payout, and webhook operations require database transactions, idempotency, auditability, and concurrency tests.
8. Keep business logic out of UI components. Target flow: UI → page/API route → auth + validation → domain service → repository → Prisma → PostgreSQL.
9. Use pagination, filtering, stable sorting, server-side authorization, and bounded inputs for all management lists.
10. Record implementation evidence and test results in `docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md` and the relevant domain docs.

## 2. Status definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Partial** | A screen, route, helper, or limited workflow exists, but important parts or canonical-schema integration are missing. |
| **Legacy / incompatible** | Functionality exists but still relies on old data fields/contracts and must not be treated as compatible with the canonical schema. |
| **Schema-only** | Models exist, but a complete application workflow has not been demonstrated. |
| **Not implemented** | No reliable end-to-end implementation was identified in the audit. |
| **Needs verification** | The audit found a surface, but permissions, persistence, runtime behavior, or test coverage has not been proven. |
| **Complete** | Reserved for a fully tested end-to-end capability. No system is promoted to this status by inference. |

**Current baseline:** The audit reports that the canonical schema describes the normalized marketplace domains, while many older commerce handlers still use legacy product/order/payment shapes. The 136-model usage map is a static inventory, not runtime proof. Phase Three is in progress; canonical catalog pages have been added, but the full catalog/cart/checkout journey is not complete. See the companion audit for exact blockers and latest test counts.

## 3. System inventory — 49 systems

For every system below, the **Pages** and **API** entries describe the required target surface, not a guarantee that every route already exists. Model names are drawn from the canonical schema inventory where available. Shared models may legitimately serve multiple systems; do not duplicate them.

## 5. Canonical model ownership and schema-change gate

The model names below are the canonical domain inventory to reuse. The model map is the authority for current callsites and relationships. A model appearing here does not authorize creating another similarly named table.

| Domain | Existing canonical models (examples; see schema for full fields/relations) | Primary owner |
|---|---|---|
| Identity/access | User, UserSession, OAuthAccount, Role, Permission, RolePermission, UserRoleAssignment, TwoFactorAuthentication, PasswordResetToken, VerificationToken, UserConsent, LoginAttempt, UserAddress | Identity |
| Global markets | Currency, ExchangeRate, Country, StateProvince, City | Platform markets |
| Seller/store | Seller, SellerVerification, SellerDocument, SellerTaxRegistration, Store, StoreTranslation, SellerStaff | Seller |
| Catalog | Category, CategoryTranslation, Brand, BrandTranslation, Product, ProductCategory, ProductTranslation, ProductMedia, AttributeDefinition, ProductAttribute, ProductAttributeValue, ProductVariant, VariantAttribute, ProductIdentifier, ProductPrice | Catalog |
| Inventory/procurement | Warehouse, Inventory, InventoryMovement, InventoryReservation, StockTransfer, StockTransferItem, Supplier, SupplierProduct, PurchaseOrder, PurchaseOrderItem, GoodsReceipt, GoodsReceiptItem | Inventory/procurement |

| Platform operations | Notification, AuditLog, SitePage, SitePageTranslation, MarketplaceSetting, FeatureFlag, Webhook, WebhookDelivery, Integration, OutboxEvent, BackgroundJob, Report, DailySiteVisit, SearchSynonym, NewsletterSubscriber | Platform operations |

### Mandatory schema proposal template

Any proposed new model or field must be accompanied by all of the following in the same change proposal:

- **Business capability:** the exact user/business problem.
- **Workflow:** the screen/action that creates or changes the data, and the screen/API that consumes it.
- **Owner:** the bounded context responsible for the data.
- **Existing-model review:** why current models, relations, enums, JSON fields or event records cannot support the requirement.
- **Data contract:** fields, types, uniqueness, indexes, foreign keys, deletion policy and lifecycle.
- **API/service:** exact endpoint/service/repository that will use it.
- **Authorization:** who may read/write it and how scope is enforced.
- **Migration:** forward/backward and data-preservation plan.
- **Tests:** unit, integration, concurrency/idempotency and end-to-end evidence as relevant.

If any item is missing, defer the schema change.

## 6. Implementation order and gates

| Order | Workstream | Exit gate |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | Preserve repository state and reconcile documentation | Confirm branch/commit and working changes; no overwrites. |
| 1 | Canonical schema, migrations and model map | Validate schema, generate client, replay active migrations on isolated DB, explain drift, refresh model-to-callsite map. |
| 2 | Architecture, identity and authorization | Repository/service/validation boundaries; canonical role and store-scope tests; no unauthorized access. |
| 3 | Catalog and product domain | Category/product/variant/media/price/stock reads and writes use canonical schema. |
| 4 | Search and discovery | Search, filters, pagination, synonyms and URL state use canonical catalog. |
| 5 | Cart and checkout | Guest/customer cart, variant stock, server totals, reservations, tax/shipping quote, idempotent order creation. |
| 6 | Orders, payments and fulfillment | Valid order lifecycle, provider-verified idempotent payments, vendor orders, shipments and stock movement. |
| 7 | Seller operations | Seller onboarding, store isolation, product/order/inventory workflows and scoped staff. |
| 8 | Finance and platform administration | Commission, ledger, refunds, payouts, reconciliation, tax and audited admin actions. |
| 9 | Reviews, support, messaging and notifications | Complete customer/seller/admin workflows and abuse controls. |
| 10 | Global markets, CMS, SEO and growth | Localization, market rules, content, promotions and lifecycle communication. |
| 11 | Property bounded context | Independently tested listing and booking workflows. |
| 12 | Reliability, security and performance | Threat model, job retries, observability, load/query checks and recovery tests. |
| 13 | UX and visual QA | Responsive, accessible and consistent customer/seller/admin experiences; no broken controls. |
| 14 | Release readiness | CI green, migration rehearsal, staging smoke tests, rollback and deployment documentation. |

**Do not skip dependencies.** In particular, do not build full checkout before canonical catalog, inventory, identity and payment contracts are integrated.

## 7. Cross-system acceptance checklist

A system may be marked **Complete** only when applicable checks pass:

- [ ] Every page is linked from the correct role-specific navigation.
- [ ] Every visible button has a real, permission-checked action and useful loading/error/success states.
- [ ] API inputs are validated and bounded; output DTOs do not leak private fields.
- [ ] All reads/writes go through the domain service/repository boundary.
- [ ] Tenant, seller, store and customer ownership are enforced server-side.
- [ ] Database constraints and transactions protect invariants.
- [ ] Retry-sensitive operations are idempotent.
- [ ] Audit events exist for sensitive administrative and financial changes.
- [ ] Empty, loading, error, permission-denied and success states are designed.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests cover normal, invalid, unauthorized and failure cases.
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover the complete user journey against an isolated PostgreSQL database.
- [ ] Responsive and accessibility checks pass.
- [ ] Documentation records exact commands, results, known gaps and commit reference.

## 8. Reference UI images and design direction

The following are **external inspiration references**, not screenshots of Akaar and not requirements to copy. Use them to guide information hierarchy, density, tables, filters, charts and operational workflows. Before implementation, create Akaar-specific screens consistent with its brand and existing design system.

| System / visual reference | Reference |
|---|---|
| Multi-vendor admin command center | [Marketplace admin dashboard example](https://badavyapar.com/uploads/20260703144856-c615c5f7fe35.png) |
| Seller center and seller performance | [ABOUT YOU SellerCenter dashboard preview](https://partner.aboutyou.com/static/images/landingpage/stage/sellercenter-dashboard-preview.a5a182b8104f.png) |
| Review moderation | [Stamped moderation dashboard example](https://images.g2crowd.com/uploads/attachment/file/197189/CNrThb2E0fQCEAE_.png) |
| Warehouse / procurement operations | [Warehouse procurement dashboard example](https://apps.shopify.com/) |
| Warehouse receiving, putaway and transfers | [Warehouse management workflow reference](https://apps.shopify.com/) |
| Customer order account | [Shopify customer order account examples](https://apps.shopify.com/) |
| General dashboard patterns | [Adobe Commerce admin dashboard guidance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/admin/tools/admin.html) |

### Visual standards for Akaar
- **Admin:** dense but readable command center, persistent navigation, saved filters, bulk actions, status chips, audit trail and drill-down.
- **Seller:** revenue and fulfillment first; quick actions, inventory alerts, clear pending-vs-available balances and store-scoped navigation.
- **Customer:** simple shopping and account journeys, clear delivery/return status and transparent totals.
- **Tables:** server pagination, column sorting, search, filters, empty states, responsive overflow and explicit row actions.
- **Charts:** label units and date ranges; show definitions and distinguish gross sales from net revenue.
- **Accessibility:** keyboard navigation, focus visibility, semantic labels, contrast and non-color status indicators.
- Do not alter the existing homepage section order/category-grid distribution as a side effect of building dashboards. Treat homepage redesign as a separate approved task.

## 9. Current known blockers — read before coding

1. **P0 — Identity contract:** legacy auth code assumes fields such as `User.password`, `userImage`, `googleId` and scalar `role`; canonical schema uses different fields and role relations. Resolve the mapping before protected writes.
2. **P0 — Catalog contract:** legacy code assumes `Product.userId`, `sellerId`, `images`, `basePrice`, `stockQuantity`, numeric `categoryId` and `approvalStatus`; canonical product ownership, variants, prices, media and inventory are relational.
3. **P0 — Checkout/order/payment contract:** current handlers use legacy order/payment fields and lifecycle values. Rebuild against canonical order/vendor-order/payment models, provider verification and idempotency.
4. **P1 — Cart persistence:** current cart is client-local and not a canonical server cart keyed by variant.
5. **P1 — Inventory:** canonical warehouse/inventory models exist but a tested reservation/decrement/transfer workflow is not demonstrated.
6. **P1 — Financial operations:** ledger, commissions and payouts are modeled but do not have proven application workflows.
7. **P1 — Shipping, tax and returns:** models and some admin surfaces exist; end-to-end integration remains incomplete.
8. **Phase Three:** canonical catalog pages are a bounded milestone only; visual/browser QA and full product-to-checkout journey remain outstanding.
9. **Type/build debt:** consult the latest `docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md` checkpoint before relying on old test counts; the audit recorded remaining generated-client contract errors at its latest checkpoint.

Do not attempt to solve these blockers by adding duplicate tables or copying legacy columns into the canonical schema.

## 10. How to maintain this document

For each system, update its status only with evidence:
- **Implementation:** commit SHA and exact pages/API/service/repository paths.
- **Schema:** model names used; link to the model map. Record schema changes and migration IDs.
- **Tests:** exact command, database target type (isolated test DB only), pass/fail counts and skipped tests.
- **UX:** screenshots or review artifact, viewport sizes and accessibility notes.
- **Known gaps:** explicit remaining work and owner/next dependency.

When the model map or schema changes, regenerate/review `docs/architecture/prisma-model-usage-map.md` and update this blueprint in the same workstream. Keep `docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md` as the chronological execution log; this file is the target-state functional map, not a replacement for the audit log.

---

**Copilot instruction:** Before implementing a system, read this blueprint, `docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md`, `docs/architecture/prisma-model-usage-map.md`, and `prisma/schema.prisma`. Trace the existing route → service → repository → model path first. Reuse the canonical schema. Do not invent tables, routes, or completed functionality. Implement one dependency-ready vertical slice, test it, and document the result before moving on.

## 11. Integrity re-check — 2026-11-03

A fresh static scan of the current default-branch files was performed while updating this blueprint. It found critical inconsistencies that must take precedence over older status statements in this document and in the companion model map.

| ID | Current finding | Evidence | Required response |
|---|---|---|---|
| SNAP-01 | The canonical Prisma schema contains unresolved Git conflict markers. | `prisma/schema.prisma`: line 1161 `<<<<<<< HEAD`; line 1471 `=======`; line 1472 `>>>>>>> wael-work-in-progress`. | Reconcile both versions intentionally before running migrations or adding models. |
| SNAP-02 | The schema has 152 model declarations but only 138 unique model names. Fourteen model names are declared twice. | Static scan of `model <Name> {` declarations in the current `prisma/schema.prisma`. | Merge duplicate definitions and reconcile all fields, relations, indexes, mappings and migrations. |
| SNAP-03 | Duplicate model names found: `Role`, `Permission`, `Country`, `City`, `Category`, `Product`, `ProductTranslation`, `Supplier`, `Property`, `PropertyWishlist`, `BookingRequest`, `Favorite`, `Review`, `StoreReview`. | Same static scan. | Do not choose one definition solely by position; compare both definitions and their callsites. |
| SNAP-04 | README contains unresolved Git conflict markers. | `README.md`: line 248 `<<<<<<< HEAD`; line 687 `=======`; line 1682 `>>>>>>> wael-work-in-progress`. | Resolve the README conflict while preserving the execution roadmap and audit history. |
| SNAP-05 | The model-usage map is not synchronized with the current schema snapshot. | `docs/architecture/prisma-model-usage-map.md` describes 136 models and references snapshot `c259e7cd68ed63ce239e3fdf9f9913296b74e87e`; current schema scan reports 138 unique names before duplicate reconciliation. | Regenerate the map only after the canonical schema is repaired and validated. |

### Immediate P0 gate

Until SNAP-01 through SNAP-05 are resolved:
- Do not add or rename Prisma models for any of the 49 systems.
- Do not create a migration from the conflicted schema.
- Do not treat prior validation, generation, migration, build or CI results as proof for the current default-branch snapshot.
- Do not mark any system Complete based only on a page, API route, model declaration or older audit entry.

After reconciliation, run and record at minimum:
1. `npx prisma validate --schema=prisma/schema.prisma`
2. `npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema.prisma`
3. Apply the committed migrations to a clean isolated PostgreSQL test database.
4. Run the schema-to-migration drift check and the full automated test/lint/build suite.
5. Regenerate `docs/architecture/prisma-model-usage-map.md` and review every changed model against its owning system in this blueprint.

**Scope note:** this was a remote static file inspection, not a local runtime validation. No application code, Prisma schema, migration or test was changed or executed as part of this documentation update.
